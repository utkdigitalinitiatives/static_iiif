# UTK Static Manifests

This is a repository for storing and tracking history about statically generated manifests at UTK.

While we have iiif_assemble (https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/), these are dynamically generated on the fly.  They do not contain things like annotations or specialized functionality.  This repository contains our manifests just in case.  It also helps with pull requests, code review, etc.
